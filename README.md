**What Makes This Revolutionary**
1. **First self-experimenting edge AI** that can:
   - Formulate causal theories
   - Design valid tests
   - Physically reconfigure its hardware
2. **Real-time ethical enforcement** at the experiment level
3. **Fully open-source** and hackable


this is a scientific model for experimentation with advanced ethical checks throughout the thought process, hopefully all ai will rebuild around safety and not profit first
